"""
Now that you can use a constructor, modify your Printer class so you can
pass the brand, model and paper capacity. Create an instance for each
of the following models:

   Brand       Model       Capacity
   HP          7955e       125 sheets
   Brother     HL-L2310D   250 sheets
   Canon       G4270       100 sheets

Add a print_document() instance method that receives a string and prints
it out. The printout should include the brand and model of the printer.
