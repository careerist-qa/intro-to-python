# A company opened in 2010 and ceased operations in 2014.
# Imagine the following list contains the number of
# employees the company for each year:

# Year:      2010   2011    2012    2013    2014
employees = [  93,   104,     89,    101,     93]

# We would like to know the following
# 1. What's the lowest number of employees the company ever had?

# 2. What's the highest number of employees the company ever had?
print(???)

# 3. What's the total head count if all employees were different every year?

# 4. How many years had 93 employees?

# 5. Can you think of a way to determine how many years the company was in business?
#    Hint: If it's one list element per year, maybe you can count the number of elements.
